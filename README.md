## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

Welcome to this hypothetical little universe which follows a hypothetical sequence of hypothetical seasons.

I am really interested in the naturally occuring types of time - and how we tend to forget about this mesasurment of time in the overbearing presence of the man-made clock. In comparison to the ticking hands of the mechanical timepiece, the natural world around us keeps track of time in a very different way, following and changing with the path of the sun in a perpertual and fairly predictable loop.

I wanted to create a hypothetical natural loop that follows similar seasonal cycles to Earth, but on a smaller scale. There are 26 images in the changing cycle, which each represent about 14 days passing. the loop cycles through 365 days worth of seasonal changes in 26 seconds.

To create the first image I began by asking generative AI to process one single "summer" landscape. I wanted it to be as broad a promt as possible so that there would be some room for the AI to essentially make choices about what it wanted to present. Then I went into photoshop with the image and continiued to apply new generative AI fill overtop each new image and add prompts to areas such as "winter snowstorm sky" "dry barren desert" "spring flowers" "wetlands" etc. The outcome was a 26 step transformation of a single AI generated image of what it percieves as natural life. 

It took some time to blend each new image into the next and there was a lot of trial and error with what the generative fill would create. I wanted the flow of time to have some logic to it which is why it roughly follows Earth's seasonal changes.

The cycle of nature always evokes a sense of wonder, with each season of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, even each day, presenting distinctly different landscapes. Yet, we are often swept away by the torrent of time, engulfed in the ceaseless pursuits of learning and work, finding it challenging to quiet our minds and appreciate the wonders of nature. Therefore, building upon the evolving natural images created by Odette, I have integrated a time selection feature. By choosing a desired time point, the system will automatically display the corresponding natural scenery, granting us the opportunity to serenely admire the natural beauty we long for. In this way, we can momentarily detach from the busyness of reality, experiencing the slow flow of time within nature.

The program offsets the number of days in the past to match the seasonal scenery in the Northern Hemisphere.

I was inspired by Ruiting's writing about the beauty and serenity of the natural world, and decided to be a bit of a debby downer. The images that appear on screen represent natural wonders of the world that are existing(the sapling), disappearing(the dying flower) and have already been lost(the gravestone). I researched the natural wonders of the earth and compiled my own dataset categorising the state of natural wonders for each continent using information from Unesco and other articles. I used the table to decide the number of each image drawn. The sketch continually generates a visualisation of the data over and over again, so the screen fills and becomes a kind of field, with the disappearing and lost natural wonders as odd ones out. The text in the middle is a reminder that the natural environment and beauty will not last forever - either impacted by the cycle of natural life itself or human actions. Nothing lasts forever!!!!!

**Overview**

I thoroughly enjoy looking at the screen filled with green leaves and roses, inspired by Kike's development of the code "Hypothetical Year." This inspiration led me to create a game about plants. I am a plant lover, although Iâ€™m not great at taking care of them. However, by developing a digital game, I can sidestep all the external factors that typically affect plant growth. I began by creating all the images I would use in this game, utilizing the â€˜Procreateâ€™ app on my iPad to craft pixel-style images for the background and plant elements.

During the process of this stage, I became aware of the requirements of the 'different pathways' requirements. I consulted ChatGPT on how to integrate these various routes into coding. After establishing the different stages within the game, I incorporated text to guide players through these stages. The game features three possible endings: two are happy, and one is not as fortunate.

**Reflection:**

Overall, Iâ€™m extremely proud of the game and its final outcome. Nevertheless, I see potential for further development by adding more images and thus more possible pathways to enhance gameplay. Real-life plant care is considerably more challenging than in the game; adding more random events and unexpected elements could make the game more engaging and surprising for players. Observing other studentsâ€™ work, I noticed some innovative uses of font styles and animations, which I aspire to incorporate into my own future projects.
